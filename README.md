### VoxFindr Description

No artist? No song-title? No problem. Have you ever heard a song on the radio, in a ride-share or out in the world and not know the artist or title, but wanted to find out?  VoxFinder is an app that locates artists and titles for songs you don't know based on a sample of song-lyrics. Just input whatever lyrics you remember, and VoxFinder will return a list of songs that contain those lyrics for you to choose from.
